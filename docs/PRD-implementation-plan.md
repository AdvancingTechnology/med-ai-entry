## Technical Architecture Decisions

### Database Design
**Firestore Collections:**
```
users/
  ├── {userId}/
      ├── profile: { name, role, orgId, preferences }
      └── sessions: { active, history, permissions }

organizations/
  ├── {orgId}/
      ├── settings: { name, ehrConfig, templates }
      ├── members: { userId, role, permissions }
      └── billing: { plan, usage, limits }

appointments/
  ├── {appointmentId}/
      ├── metadata: { patientId, providerId, timestamp }
      ├── transcript: { messages[], audioFiles[], status }
      ├── analysis: { hpi, orders, confidence, edits }
      └── exports: { athenaId, timestamp, status }
```

### Security Implementation
1. **Data Encryption:**
   - AES-256 encryption for PHI at rest
   - TLS 1.3 for all data in transit
   - Field-level encryption for sensitive data

2. **Access Control:**
   - Firebase Security Rules
   - JWT token validation
   - Role-based route protection
   - API rate limiting

3. **Audit Requirements:**
   - Every PHI access logged
   - 11-year retention policy
   - Quarterly security reviews
   - SOC 2 Type II preparation

### Performance Targets
- **Page Load Time:** < 2 seconds
- **Voice Recognition Latency:** < 500ms
- **AI Processing Time:** < 10 seconds
- **EHR Export Time:** < 5 seconds
- **Uptime SLA:** 99.9%

### Error Handling Strategy
1. **Graceful Degradation:**
   - Voice fails → text input
   - AI fails → manual entry
   - EHR fails → local storage + retry

2. **User Feedback:**
   - Clear error messages
   - Recovery action suggestions
   - Progress indicators
   - Success confirmations

### Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Tests:** 80% code coverage minimum
2. **Integration Tests:** API endpoints and database operations
3. **E2E Tests:** Critical user journeys
4. **Manual QA:** Medical accuracy validation
5. **Security Testing:** Penetration tests quarterly
